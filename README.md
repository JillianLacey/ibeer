# iBeer - CSS Layout & Flexbox
- HTML
- CSS



Description  

Jonathan Goldsmith, the Dos Equis guy, needs someone to help him finish the styling of his 'i Beer' blog. He has provided you with a mockup, the complete HTML, and a partially complete CSS file. Your job is to finish the layout and match the visual styles of the mockup with CSS. To match the 'blog' mockup, you will need to use the following:

Positioning
Flexbox
Floating
Instructions  

Download and unpack the starter files
Review the mockup and the HTML file to see which HTML elements correspond to visual content in the mockup
Review the CSS file. It already has a number of styles, so familiarize yourself with what has already been done and what is left to do.
Read all of the TODOs in the CSS file before you begin. Some of the TODOs are layout related and some are general styling related.

For this project we are using the 'Google fonts' API.  

The fonts are:

'Josefin Sans'
'Noto Serif'
'Dancing Script'


COLORS:

light tan: #eeebda
